# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




# Props 
Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only components
It gives a way to pass data from one component to other components ( Parent to Child component)
<Component key = value />

# Prop Types 
a mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of correct datatype
age : propTypes.number

# Default Props 
Default values for props in case they are not passed from the parent component 
name : "Guest"


# Conditional Rendering 
It allows you to control what gets rendered in app based on certain conditions
(show, hide, change components)
